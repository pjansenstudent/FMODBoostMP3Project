## FMOD based mp3 player
### Made by Peter Jansen Â©2015 (though feel free to use this code, there's nothing really special in it anyway)
### About
This program was made as part of an educational project in 2015, when I was first refining my skills in C++, the project was to make a program using boost libraries to accomplish a set of goals: which I chose to create a basic mp3 player.

As such, this program requires the boost C++ libraries, as well as the FMOD API. 

Boost is available here: [Boost Libraries](https://www.boost.org)
FMOD is available from FMOD's website here (requires sign up): [FMOD Website](https://www.fmod.com)

NOTE: currently, the makefile and build process is set up for Linux 64-bit only.
